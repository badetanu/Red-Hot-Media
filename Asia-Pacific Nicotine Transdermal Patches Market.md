Smokers in this category are often at a stage where they recognize the long-term health risks associated with smoking and are motivated to seek help to quit. The nicotine patch is particularly popular among individuals in this demographic due to its gradual delivery of nicotine, which helps manage cravings without the immediate urge to smoke.

One major trend is the increasing emphasis on health and wellness among consumers, particularly in countries where smoking rates have traditionally been high.
