The demand for seasoning blends tailored to mass-consumption foods such as nachos, burgers, and pizza is steadily increasing, as venue operators look for cost-effective solutions that do not compromise on flavor.

This category encompasses the direct use of seasonings and dressings by individual consumers in their homes. As more Americans prioritize cooking at home, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in demand for flavorful and easy-to-use products that help elevate the taste of everyday meals. Dressings such as vinaigrettes, ranch, and Caesar, as well as a wide range of seasoning blends, are essential for adding variety and taste to a variety of dishes, from salads to grilled meats and vegetables.
