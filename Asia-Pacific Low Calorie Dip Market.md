This trend is being met with innovations in the production of dips using plant-based ingredients like legumes, vegetables, and nuts.Another important trend is the increasing popularity of low-calorie snacks and healthier eating habits among the younger demographic. This is particularly true in urban centers, where busy lifestyles and higher disposable incomes contribute to a greater demand for convenient, healthier food options. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on clean label products, which are free from artificial ingredients and preservatives, making them more attractive to health-conscious consumers.
